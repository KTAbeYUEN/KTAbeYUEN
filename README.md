- 👋 Hi, I’m @KTAbeYUEN
- 👀 I’m interested in cook, daydreaming and system thinking...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and with special interest in analysis (for business)
- 💞️ I’m looking for anyone who are new to IT (without such training before) and like to learn how to code
- 📫 You can reach me via email ktayatk@vivaldi.net
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am not good at math and now no longer young but I just want to learn to code. My first encounter with IT was long time ago then it was called EDP and my clients were using IBM system 34...
